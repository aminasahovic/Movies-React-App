# My Very First React Project 

Welcome to my very first React project! This app is designed to help me learn the basics of React. Here's a quick overview:

- It enables you to fetch movie data from an external API.
- The fetched data is then displayed in the form of cards.
- Plus, I've even added a pagination feature to make browsing through a large number of movies a breeze.
